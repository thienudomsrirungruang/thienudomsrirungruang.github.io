const bio = `Hi! I'm a high school student (currently in my final year) who's interested in computer science, programming and math. I've been programming since I was 9, and have done some interesting and fun projects since then - have a look below!

Some of my more specific academic interests are in artificial intelligence and theoretical computer science, and I've taken part in multiple online programming competitions, getting a Top 200 finish in the Facebook Hacker Cup 2020.

I'm also interested in speedcubing and rhythm games.`;
